                    <h3>Reinvest Start</h3>
                    <p>The date when the fund enters the reinvestment phase, allowing capital returned from investments to be redeployed into new opportunities rather than being distributed to investors. During this phase, while capital is reinvested, income distributions may still occur.</p>

                    <p>The date when the fund enters the harvesting phase, during which the focus shifts from making new investments to realizing returns on existing investments. After this date, capital returned from investments is distributed to investors rather than being reinvested. This marks the end of the reinvestment phase.</p>

                    <h3>Total Capital Called</h3>
                    <p>The cumulative amount of capital that the fund has requested from an LP to date, also known as drawn capital or paid-in capital.</p>

                <div className="definition-item">
                    <h3>Capital Distribution</h3>
                    <p>The return of originally invested capital (principal) to the LP. This represents a return of the LP's investment, not a profit.</p>
                </div>

                    <p>The amount of an LP's capital still invested in the fund. This can be calculated in two ways:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cash-Based (Called Amount â€“ Capital Distribution)</strong>: A conservative measurement that only tracks the flow of capital called and returned, without considering appreciation or depreciation.</li>
                        <li><strong>NAV-Based (PCAP Ending Capital Balance)</strong>: Reflects the current fair market value of the LP's investment, including any appreciation or depreciation. This method is typically used for funds in the reinvestment phase.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <div className="definition-item">
                    <h3>IRR (Internal Rate of Return)</h3>
                    <p>A metric used to estimate the profitability of investments, representing the annualized effective compounded return rate. The IRR calculation includes all cash flows (Capital Calls as negative flows, Distributions as positive flows) and the current Ending Capital Balance as of the PCAP Report Date.</p>

                <div className="definition-item">
                    <h3>XIRR</h3>
                    <p>A variation of IRR that allows for irregular cash flow timing. The application calculates IRR using the same method as Microsoft Excel's XIRR function.</p>

                    <h3>PCAP Report Date</h3>
                    <p>The most recent fiscal quarter end date available in the data that is equal to or less than the Report Date. PCAP data represents the official quarterly snapshot of capital activity.</p>

                    <h3>Reinvestment Phase</h3>
                    <p>The period between Reinvest Start and Harvest Start dates when capital returned from investments can be redeployed rather than distributed to investors. This phase allows fund managers to continue growing the fund's assets through reinvestment.</p>
                </div>

                <div className="definition-item">
                    <h3>Reinvestment + Distributions</h3>
                    <p>During the reinvestment phase, capital (principal) can be reused for new investments, while income generated still flows to LPs as yield. This is why a fund in reinvestment phase may show income distributions even though capital remains locked and working.</p>

                <div className="definition-item">
                    <h3>Harvesting Phase</h3>
                    <p>The period after the Harvest Start date when the fund shifts focus from making new investments to realizing returns on existing investments and returning capital to investors.</p>
